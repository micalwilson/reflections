When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?

A remote repository allows you to share your repository with others and 
also to access it from other computers yourself. Also, it is a way to 
back up your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may not want to have all of your changes be released publicly. It is 
better if you have control over what gets pushed when you are ready.
