What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? 
It creates a hidden .git directory in the current directory to contain 
all the git files in a new repository. You do it to create a repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers? The staging area is a 
holding area for files that we have determined should be committed, but 
have not been committed yet. It lets us configure git how we want before 
we create our first commit. Otherwise there would be several early 
commits that only have some of the files.
